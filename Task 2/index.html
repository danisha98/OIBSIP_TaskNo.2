            <p> 
                <b>Aryabhata</b> is one of the most renowned Indian Mathematicians, in fact, one of the firsts. Born in the Gupta era that is 
                during the rule of the Gupta Dynasty in 475 CE in Kusumapura, Pataliputra, he was known for his extraordinary knowledge in
                the astronomical field. He has written many treaties in both mathematics and astronomy. He was also the author of many 
                mathematical books which to date is considered holy and reverend immensely. Many of his works were lost, but some are still 
                available for modern scholars and hold great credibility. And his inventions, discoveries and contributions have brought 
                pride to our country. It has also inspired many budding scientists to follow his path and make discoveries.

            <p>
                The <b>Aryabhatiya</b> is widely regarded as Aryabhata's crowning achievement. He wrote numerous treatises throughout his 
                career, and this was one of them. It is unfortunate that not all of what he had written is still available. Historians 
                can only conjecture as to what could have been the tremendous importance of his works that have been lost. <b><i>Mathematics 
                and astronomy were well-represented in the Aryabhatiya</i></b>, which was a comprehensive treatise. The work was saved from 
                oblivion thanks to quotations from it in other works. In the mathematics aspect of the work, a lot of attention was 
                paid to subjects like <b>plane trigonometry and spherical trigonometry, as well as arithmetic, quadratic equations, and algebra.</b>

                        <b>Aryabhatiya</b> and <b>Arya-Siddhanta</b>, two of his most important writings, are still extant. In both of his publications, he examined the connection 
                        between mathematics and astronomy. Mathematical equations may be used to discover the workings of our universe via astronomy, according to the 
                        speaker. Some of the highlights are:

        <p> The contributions of a scientist since Aryabhata has never been the same. He truly made the world notice India, in terms of 
            holding scientific knowledge and value that made a difference to the world. He challenged and contradicted many beliefs that 
            were going on at the time and through calculations provided pieces of evidence for it to be true. And after all these years, 
            his work does not flinch from meticulous accuracy. There are very few scientists who achieved in their lifetime an extraordinary 
            duty of work and Aryabhata was one of them. India recognizes his contributions. His work was widely popular and appreciated in the 
            Islamic world especially his astronomical discoveries which were translated into Arabic in the 8th Century.<b>The first Indian 
            Satellite</b> to be sent to space was named after him as a tribute. He was the first in the classical age of India that excelled as a 
            mathematician and an astronomer. At the time, without any advanced technology available, being able to estimate and approximate his 
            discoveries was truly remarkable. We must take pride in his works as Indians. 
        <p>
            He died at the age of 74 after a long and fruitful career as mathematics, astronomer, and scientist. When and where he died are still 
            unknown. In Kusumapura, Pataliputra, it was thought that he spent most of his time.Aryabhata's work was of great influence in the 
            Indian astronomical tradition and influenced several neighbouring cultures through translations.</p>
